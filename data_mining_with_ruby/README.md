# Codeschool 1-3 Hour Crash Course - Data Mining with Ruby

In this crash course, students will write a simple Ruby program to parse and iterate over a csv file of risk data from a survey. The goal of this course is to use code to more easily draw correlations between potentially related data points and to teach the students a little about setting up and running a trivial Ruby program.

## Starter Files for Students

In `starter_files.zip`, you will find all the files a student will need to begin the course:

* results.rb
* steak-risk-survey.csv

`results.rb` is left empty except for a few omments to be implemented during the crash course.

`results_final.rb` contains the final js that the students will write during the course.

## Coursework

The documents contained in the `data_mining_with_ruby` folder are intended to for the TIYO crash course `Codeschool 1-3 Hour Crash Course - Data Mining with Ruby`. Please direct students to that crash course so that they can use the lessons and exercises contained there.

## Lesson Plan

Lesson Plans and Lecture notes can be found in final unit of the Crash Course on TIYO entitles `Instructor Resources`
