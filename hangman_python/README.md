# Codeschool 1-3 Hour Crash Course - Build a Hangman Game with Python

This Crash Course is intended to teach some of the basic features of the Python language by developing a 'Hangman' game in the console. By applying python to the development of a simple console game, students will use functions, branching logic, variables, tuples, user input, prompts and modules.

This course assumes that students have Python installed on their computers and have both a text editor and a terminal/console emulator.

## Starter Files for Students

In `starter_files.zip`, you will find all the files a student will need to begin the course:

* functions.py
* hangman.py
* messages.py

`hangman.py` is left blank. This is the file where students will write their game logic.

`functions.py` contains a list of utility functions for the program.

`messages.py` contains a multidimensional list of snarky messages that can be output to the player when they make an incorrect guess.

## Starter Files for Instructor

`demo/hangman.py` contains a completed version of the game logic. It is heavily commented to assist the instructor teaching the crash course.

## Coursework

The documents contained in the `hangman_python` folder are intended for the TIYO crash course `Codeschool 1-3 Hour Crash Course - Build a Hangman Game with Python`. Please direct students to that crash course so that they can use the lessons and exercises contained there.

## Lesson Plan

Lesson Plans and Lecture notes can be found in final unit of the Crash Course on TIYO entitles `Instructor Resources`
